When working locally outside UNA environment, you must:

1) Reactivate Font Awesome library ( Uncomment in <head> )
2) Reactivate jQuery library ( Uncomment in <script> )

Currently, pages Arabic font is set to Changa for headings, Tajawal for body and Quicksand for SehaSky English word, but if Nunito font will be used throughout whole SehaSky site, you must re-load Nunito Google font ( Uncomment in <head> ) and set font-family for for SehaSky English word to Nunito
