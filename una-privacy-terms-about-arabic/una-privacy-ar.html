            If you choose to connect to a third party service which is a source of health data, such as your doctor, we

            have entered into your PHR manually.
            <br>
            <br>
            Where you use a third party service via our app or website, we will pass only that information to them which
            is required for the functioning of that service. This will normally be information which allows the service
            to identify you as the originator of the request, and information relating to the specific service you are
            requesting. It will not generally include any information from your PHR; we will make it clear if it does.
            When you sign up for such a service, there may be additional terms of use and a privacy policy relating to
            that service, which you should read and understand before using the service. We will always try to be clear
            about exactly what information is being communicated between our services and others.

            <br>
            <br>
            We may also receive information about you from third parties to facilitate provision of applicable Services.
            This may include information provided from your doctor or other healthcare provider such as your name, NHS
            number and relevant contact details as well as sensitive information about you including your medical

         <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of

         <h2 id="storage_location">How do we store your personal information?</h2>

         <p>We will store your personal information within our infrastructure using one or more Third-Party Service
            Providers, which are all located in the European Economic Area. All data will be encrypted when being
            transferred.
            <br>
            <br>
            Your data may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area, for example, if we use a cloud service
            that has host servers located in another country. If your data is transferred outside of the European
            Economic Area, it is done so under contract, which states how those companies or individuals must keep your
            data safe.
            <br>
            <br>
            We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely through strict
            procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access to your personal information.

            <br>
         </p>

         <h2 id="storage_duration">How long do we keep your personal information?</h2>

         <p>
            We will retain your personal information for as long as needed to fulfil the purposes of providing our
            services to you or for a period specifically required by applicable regulations or laws. For example, where
            you are registered for any of our Services, we generally keep your personal information for the duration of
            time you utilise that Service.
            <br>
            <br>
            When determining the relevant retention periods, we will consider factors including:

         </ul>
         <p>Otherwise, we securely erase or anonymise your personal information where we no longer require your

               keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure, there are exceptions.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing; you have rights to "block" or suppress further use of your
               information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it
               further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be "blocked" to
               make sure the restriction is respected in future.</li>
            <li>The right to data portability; you have rights to obtain and reuse your information for your own
               purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables
               you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and
               securely, without affecting its usability.</li>
            <li>The right to lodge a complaint; you have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or
               process your information with your national data protection regulator. See details of the UK data
               protection regulator in the contact us section below.
            </li>
            <li>The right to withdraw consent; if you have given your consent to anything we do with your information,
               you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that
               anything we have done with your information with your consent up to that point is unlawful). Note that
               such withdrawal in certain circumstance may mean we can no longer continue to provide the Services to
               you.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge a reasonable fee to cover

         </ul>
         <p>Alternatively, we may be entitled to refuse to act on the request. Please consider your request responsibly
            before submitting it. We will respond as soon as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when
            we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we will come back to you
            and let you know.
