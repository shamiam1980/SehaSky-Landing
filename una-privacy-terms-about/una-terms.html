         <h2 id="services_phr">Personal Health Record (PHR)</h2>
         <p>The PHR is your personal record. It"s a place where you can store your own health information (such as
            allergies, conditions, medications, documents, and measurements) and import information from various sources
            in order to create a record which is as complete as possible. If you connect to another source of health
            data (for example, your GP system using the GP access feature), we will copy information from that source
            into your PHR so that it is always available to you. Your PHR is your data, you own it and you control it.
            We will not give or sell it to anyone else unless you tell us to.
            <br>
            <br>

         <p>The Trusted Access feature gives you the option to give access to your selected data and/or your Doctor
            record with other persons through the our application. Once the other person has created their account with
            us and accepted your invitation, they will be able to see the information you have chosen to give them
            access to. They will also be able to add entries into your PHR. If you decide to use the Trusted Access
            feature, you acknowledge the following:
         </p>
         <ul class="content-list">
            <li>You can choose to share parts of your record and keep other parts private;</li>
            <li>You are responsible for ensuring that the email you have provided is correct for the person you

               information;</li>
            <li>We cannot and do not take any responsibility for what the other person will do with your information,
               for example:

                     The other person may unintentionally or otherwise share your information with a third party;

                  <li>
                     We do not carry out any checks or due diligence on the other person; and we cannot stop or force
                     any person to delete your information once you have provided them with access.

         <h2 id="account_how">How do I open a SehaSky account?</h2>
         <p>
            Anyone who is a resident of Egypt and is 13 years of age or older and creates an account can use the
            Service.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are under the age of 13 years (a "Child"), then you may only register for an account and use the
            Service if prior consent has been given by your parent or guardian, and they have agreed to these terms, as
            the party to this agreement, on your behalf.
            <br>
            <br>
            By creating an account within the application on behalf of a Young Person, you are agreeing that you are the
            Responsible Person for that Young Person and will take the necessary steps upon the Young Person reaching 13
            years old, to enable the Young Person to take over their Personal Health Record. When you register for an
            account it is important that you understand that each registration is for a single user only. We do not
            permit you to share your username and password with any other person nor with multiple users on a network.
            <br>
            <br>
            In order to use the Service, we require you to create an account by providing us with your name, email
            address and a strong password. You are responsible for the activity that occurs in association with your
            account. Responsibility for the security of any passwords issued rests with you. There are also some
            technical requirements as to whether you can use the services.
         </p>

         <h2 id="account_comm">Communicating with you</h2>
         <p>
            We'll usually communicate with you through the app or through the website, but we may also communicate with
            you by email, so you should regularly check your email account. You can specify which types of communication
            you would like to receive from us by declaring your preferences in the application.
            <br>
            <br>
            Please keep your details up to date and let us know immediately if any information you've given us changes.
            If we discover that any of your information is incorrect, we will update it.
         </p>

         <h2 id="account_close">How do I close my account?</h2>
         <p>
            You can close your account, and so end the agreement, at any time by letting us know. Please contact the
            website administrator through <a class="privacy-policy" href="https://sehasky.com/main/page/contact">Contact
               Us</a> form to request closure of your account.‍
         </p>

         <h2 id="account_protect">How is my account protected?</h2>
         <p>
            We will help keep your account and personal information safe, secure and private. Your account is password
            protected to prevent unauthorised access by anyone else.
            <br>
            <br>
            The data that is entered, transmitted and stored is encrypted to prevent any unauthorised use of the data.
            <br>
            <br>
            The electronic transmission of data over the internet is never completely secure but we endeavour to make
            the service as secure as possible and provide a high level of security for your personal healthcare
            information.
            <br>
            <br>
            You are also responsible for the safety of your information. You should choose a strong password and be sure
            that you don't let anybody else know it. Keep your mobile phone and email account secure and don't let other
            people use them. If you suspect that somebody else has used your account without permission, you should
            reset your password immediately. If in doubt, please get in touch with us.
         </p>

         <h2 id="account_restrictions">Are there any restrictions on using my account?</h2>
         <p>
            All that we ask is that you act reasonably and responsibly when using your account. Do not use it for
            illegal purposes or in a way that might harm our ability to provide our services.
            <br>
            <br>
            Please also act in a respectful way towards us and our support staff. We are here to help you :).
         </p>

         <h2 id="account_block">When we might block or close your account?</h2>
         <p>
            The safety of your data is important to us. We might prevent you from accessing your account if we're
            reasonably concerned about its security. We'll tell you before, or as soon as possible after, we block or
            close your account. We'll also let you know why we've done it (unless it would reduce your or our security
            or it would be unlawful). We may close or suspend your account immediately, and end your access to our
            website, in exceptional circumstances or where we cease to provide this service. If we are ceasing to
            provide the service, we will endeavour to let you know in advance.
         </p>

         <h2 id="account_resposibility">Are you responsible if something goes wrong with
            my account or for information provided through the account?</h2>
         <p>
            We'll do as much as reasonably possible to make sure that our services are not interrupted, are available 24
            hours a day and are accessible at a reasonable speed. However, we can't promise that this will always be the
            case or that the services will be free from faults. We also rely on some third parties to provide services
            to you, which can sometimes disrupt our services. we'll always do our best to solve any problems with our
            services, no matter what the cause.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are not responsible for the accuracy, quality and use of all of the information which can be accessed and
            viewed by you, but we are responsible for some of it.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are not responsible for your Doctor Record or the information it contains; we accept no liability for
            information (whether accurate or not) on health advice, therapy, diagnosis and or treatment, in patient
            information leaflets and/or the information contained in medical notes, consultation records and/or other
            records. Sometimes we may direct you to external websites which may be accessed by and displayed on our
            software; we accept no liability for the information (whether accurate or not) that they contain. We do
            however make sure that the information that we provide to you is verified and that the references are
