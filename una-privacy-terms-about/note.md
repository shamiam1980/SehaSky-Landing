When working locally outside UNA environment, you must:

1) Reactivate Font Awesome library ( Uncomment in <head> )
2) Reactivate jQuery library ( Uncomment in <script> )

Currently, pages font is set to Quicksand, but if Nunito font will be used throughout whole SehaSky site,
you must re-load Nunito Google font ( Uncomment in <head> ) and set font-family for body to Nunito
